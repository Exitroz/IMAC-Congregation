                  Born in Bena-Kazadi-Tshikula, Democratic Republic of the Congo, on July 22, 1940, he was appointed in 1982 as Pope John Paul II’s second secretary, service that lasted until 1987. He worked side-by-side with John Paul II from 1982 to 1987, traveling alongside the Pope on all his international trips.

                  On December 10, 1987 Pope John Paul II gave him the personal title of Archbishop of Luebo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and on January 6, 1988 he received his episcopal order from Pope John Paul II.

                  Before his appointment as Personal Secretary to Pope John Paul II, Archbishop Kabongo was working at the Vatican’s Secretariat of State until, one day, he received a call from the Pope, as he recalls in the book Accanto Giovanni Paolo II (“Side by Side with John Paul II”): “My first memory of John Paul II was when he appointed me as his personal secretary, so that I could help his first secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz. I didn’t write a letter or ask for an appointment. That’s why I thank him for his Catholic mentality and for thinking that an African would be a good secretary.”
